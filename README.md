# Litecoin-for-universities
Litecoin questions - you have to know why we choose litecoin!!!

1.There is more number of litecoins than number of bitcoin (around 4 times more - 84 000 000 to 21 000 000) - is it true?

2.Bitcoin is cryptocurrency gold and litecoin is cryptocurrency silver - is it true?

3.Litecoin is faster than bitcoin - is it true?

4.Litecoin is cheaper than bitcoin - is it true?

5.Litecoin almost always has less than 0.01$ for transfer - is it true?

6.Litecoin transfer takes less than 15 minutes - is it true?

7.Older, proven cryptocurrencies are more often supported for payments in online stores than new cryptocurrencies - is it true?

8.Shops offering almost all cryptocurrencies as a form of payment can have a small catch!!! Shops usually have their cryptocurrency accounts in proven cryptocurrencies that have been on the market for a very long time (for example, bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum, etc.). When paying with newer cryptocurrencies, an exchange office is automatically activated in the background, which will convert the selected cryptocurrency to the cryptocurrency that the shop has (for example, litecoin, bitcoin, ethereum, etc.). And now important!!! When paying with a new cryptocurrency, the customer may invisibly pay a commission for this conversion!!! So this is a small disadvantage of new cryptocurrencies, unless that changes someday - is it true?

9.ATM are very ok with litecoin comparing to other cryptocurrencies - is it true?

10.Litecoin is very long in market so there is a lot of already supported places - is it true?

11.Bitcoin/Litecoin to gold/silver comparison inconsistency (litecoin adventage):
Physical gold transportation costs are much lower than silver transportation costs, due to weight in real life.
In cryptocurrencies transportation costs of silver (litecoin) are much lower than gold (bitcoin) - is it true?

12.There have been cases in Bitcoin where a transfer of $120 resulted in a fee of $80 ($200 in total), while in Litecoin it never ever exceeded $1 - is it true?

-----------------------------------
Tests results:
-----------------------------------

Of the 10 selected compatible cryptocurrencies, 6 universities were to conduct speed and quality tests, take into account transaction fees and sort the cryptocurrencies by assigning them points from 1 to 10. After counting, the following results were obtained:

48 points -> 1  place (litecoin)

41 points -> 2  place (hidden)

38 points -> 3  place (hidden)

34 points -> 4  place (hidden)

31 points -> 5  place (hidden)

30 points -> 6  place (hidden)

29 points -> 7  place (hidden)

29 points -> 8  place (hidden)

26 points -> 9  place (hidden)

24 points -> 10 place (hidden)

this was the basis for implementing university payments. work is in progress, on June 23, 2025 there will be the first online presentation for computers, eventually the application will be mobile.

Hi guys, I am after presentation and I am very supprised about progress. I dont know how Krakow team did their part, but it is working faster than my 3 wallet applications on my phone!!! I am waiting for described code from their side.
Probably we have to move from here, I will let you know for sure soon.
I am waiting for acceptation and I will add screens from desktop application. I think it will be something really BIG, I have a lot of requests from technical schools, they also sow the presentation.
We are focusing still on our part (authorization and documenting) however its not all... We have new requirements connected with ZK (zero knowledge) and "mixer for privacy".
If you have some sccomplished milestones - please let me know ASAP.

Thanks and please all work hard, because we are doing something big, nobody expects this before...

Second presentation - 15.09.2025. I will be participating and let you know what is going on now.
If you have questions which I should ask, email me plesase.


Good point from Vado, do you have questions for test version for all universities?
And please let me know which test version is more important for you according to your implementation part - mobile test version or desktop test version?
Please send questions/suggestions to 14.09.2025 20:00 max if possible, I have to combine them, thanks for questions/suggestions so far.

-----

Hi guys, sorry for delay.
Again WOW, the application is working with new features like "request for money" etc. Very good news is that in 2-3 weeks we have demo version to test for us all, so you will see by yourself.
Info - please DO NOT share your code in internet, there will be our copyright.
Cannot wait to show you, it is really pearl. BRs

-----

Please send me your stable part of code to 25.09.2025 16:00 max please, we will get test version soon in few days.
Reminder ;)
Ok I've got all, compiling and I will send you all email with link. Please let me know if you need test version.

Good, it looks like all we have test version, test it please, curl, wget,... everything, but the main point is transfering litecoin, please report your all transactions with details! Time taken, amount etc.
