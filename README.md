litecoin questions school

1.There is more number of litecoins than number of bitcoin (around 4 times more - 84 000 000 to 21 000 000) - is it true? 
2.Bitcoin is cryptocurrency gold and litecoin is cryptocurrency silver - is it true? 
3.Litecoin is faster than bitcoin - is it true? 
4.Litecoin is cheaper than bitcoin - is it true? 
5.Litecoin almost always has less than 0.01$ for transfer - is it true? 
6.Litecoin transfer takes less than 15 minutes - is it true? 
7.Older, proven cryptocurrencies are more often supported for payments in online stores than new cryptocurrencies - is it true? 
8.Shops offering almost all cryptocurrencies as a form of payment can have a small catch!!! Shops usually have their cryptocurrency accounts in proven cryptocurrencies that have been on the market for a very long time (for example, bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum, etc.). When paying with newer cryptocurrencies, an exchange office is automatically activated in the background, which will convert the selected cryptocurrency to the cryptocurrency that the shop has (for example, litecoin, bitcoin, ethereum, etc.). And now important!!! When paying with a new cryptocurrency, the customer may invisibly pay a commission for this conversion!!! So this is a small disadvantage of new cryptocurrencies, unless that changes someday - is it true? 
9.ATM are very ok with litecoin comparing to other cryptocurrencies - is it true? 
10.Litecoin is very long in market so there is a lot of already supported places - is it true?
